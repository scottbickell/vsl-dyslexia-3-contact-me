Help Your Students with Dyslexia Conquer Reading Challenges

Dear %%first_name%%,

Students with dyslexia often face visual and auditory processing challenges resulting in difficulties with decoding words and in-depth analysis of text. Scientific research-based reading intervention with scaffolded support is essential for building literacy skills and confidence. The most effective solutions follow the Structured Literacy approach, endorsed by the International Dyslexia Association. Learn more about these programs, which align with the principles of Structured Literacy and support students with dyslexia.
